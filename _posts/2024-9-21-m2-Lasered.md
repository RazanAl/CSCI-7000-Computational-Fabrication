# M1: 'Seeing is believing' - ComFab Examples

## Description

This Post contains 2 parts, the firstdiscuss the following two assignment 2 tasks:
1. Generating 3 computational designs.
2. Laser cutting one of the designs and engraving another.
The second section discusses "failures" and aspirations. These are failed designs or design enhacements. 

## Task 1: Computational Designs
### 1. Circle-cutter: 
Remember the elementry school trick of cutting a small paper to pass through it? The same cutting technique is used on wood to add flexability 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:461749. In this design I apply this cut to a circle, where the user can control the number of cuts and the margin between the cuts/ edges. 


### 2. coral leaves 

### 3. Gears: 

## Task 2: Lasered! 
### a: Laser cut gears

### b. Laser Engraved coral Leaves.
