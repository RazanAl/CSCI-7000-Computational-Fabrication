# Description

This assignemnt has the following 2 tasks: 
1. Generating 3 computational designs.
2. Laser cutting one of the designs and engraving another.
   
This post contains 3 parts each corrosponding to a design. In each section I discuss the design, failed attempts if any, future uses, and whether the design was laser cut or engraved. The code to the designs can be found by clicking on the design name. If an image is not created by me, you can click on it to go to its source. 

# Designes 
## 1. [Circle-cutter](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/blob/main/code/M2_CircleCutter/M2_Circlecutter.pde): 
Remember the elementry school trick of cutting a small paper to pass through it? If not, it is shown in the image below:

The same cutting technique can be used on wood to add flexability and create bendable wood.

The number of the cuts in a given piece and the margins determine the flexibilty and sturdiness; Too few cuts lead to stiffer shapes, and too many cuts lead to a smaller margin between cuts and hence a more breakage-prone shape.  In this design I specify the cutuing lines on a circle, given the circle's radius r, the margins m, and the number of 3-cut sets n, where a 3-cut set includes 2 edge cuts and a middle cut.
A sample output is shown below:

I start with a circle because the goal was to further adjust it to work on spherical pattern cuts and make a sphere of wood, but that goal is too ambitious for this assignment given the time and experience limitations. 
The code linked has explanatory comments that describe the process, and the annotated image below shows the main variables referenced in the code.

Simply put, the code divides the circle to n regions, and loops throguh the regions to calculate the 6 coordinate pairs needed to make the 3 cuts in each region.



## 2. [Leafy Vines](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/blob/main/code/M2_tree/M2_tree.pde): 
I was disappointed to see that Turtle's  "tree" example is a leafless tree. So For my next design I decided to add leaves. I initially spent so much time trying to figure out the parameters and mathematical calculations for the following two approaches: 
1. Spirals, starting at the turtle and symmetric on the turtle's path.
2. A semi circle with tangent curves, also symmetric on the line of turtle's heading.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/Leaves.jpeg)
Non of them worked as I hoped as the resulting leaf was either too round or the 2 symmetric shapes would go further beyond their intersection points. When I got decent looking leafs, rotating them to align with the turtle heading was another struggle. I eventually decided to consult google and found [this leaf drawing code](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/7743/). It draws a neat leaf using Processing shapes and bezierVertices. By quickly looking at videos/images explaining what bezier curves are, I based my design on the following assumption/conclusion:
Say the last vertex drawn was (x1,y1), and you add a bezierVertex(x2,y2, x3,y3,x4,y4). This adds a curve with two ends : (x1,y1) and (x4,y4), where the curve is tanget to th line passing through (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) at (x1,y1), and the curve is tanget to the line passing though (x3,y3) and (x4,y4) at (x4,y4). With this understanding - which I did not investigate further - I made my own leaf. In the example linked, they use a single shape for the leaf, but I did not get how they made the leaf pointy as my full leaf shape looks blobby... So I desided to make each leaf-side a sperate shape. I parameturized the leaf length (L) and specified the leaf tip point (x4,y4) by moving the turtle forwad L steps and capturing the cordinates. To draw the leaf stem the turtle goes back dropping the pen half way through.
The curve control points (x2, y2) and (x3,y3) were chosen to roughly fall on the sides of the leaf. This only works for leafs that are pointing slightly upward as a more mathimatically involved claculation is needed to make it work for horizontal/ downward pointg leaves.
When I added the leaves to the Turtle tree code, it looked nice on the first couple branches but became indistinguishably crowded at the end, so, I decided to apply them on vertical vines instead. The code loops through the number of vines, and randomly selects the vine's location within a selected frame of the window. Within each iteration, the code loops along a randomly selected number of leaves on each vine, in each iteration, the turtle moves forward a random number of steps, then randomly selects a side (right/left) to draw the leaf. The side is chosen by randomly selecting a number and checking its parity.
Due to the randomness of the code, I had to run it multiple times until I got a sketch I find visually balanced, as some runs result in crowded vines, or vines with leaves mostly on one side. I still did not want the vine and leaves placements to be non-randomized because I did not want it to look too "clean" and algorithmic. I etched the design on a 5" * 3" piece of card board.
You can see the generated design here (top) , as well as the etched design (bottom).

## 3. [Gears](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/blob/main/code/M2_gears/M2_gears.pde): 
I like articulate parts, hence my last design is a set of gears where the user selects the number of gear ridges/teeth and their size. I based this desin on [this simple gear design](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-gears-easily/) . Although this is the simplist gear design I could find it still required some involved calculations. 
First, I figured that to have n tangent circles each of radius r around a larger circle, I could start with a regular n-polygon with sidelength 2*r, then draw circles centered at the polygon's verticies.
I confirmed this by using [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator). below is an image of my geometric design on geogebra. You can ignore the labels, both english and arabic, and focus on the dark black gear-like shape from tracing the circles:)

Then, I changed the Turtle's polygon example to draw an arc every time the turtle reaches a new vertex. The arc direction ( convexity/concavity with respect to the polygon's center) depends on the parity of the polygon vertex. The end angles of the arc were determined based on the turtle's heading angle (h) and the number of sides (n). The code was written before I knew about processing's radians() function so it includes degree-to-radian conversion. Other than radians conversion, the design required a little angle chasing, as seen in the image below. 
![angle chasing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/M2GearAngleChasing.jpeg)


To experiment, I tried nesting as many gears as possible in a single cut. Not all polygon sizes worked as the polygon example provided by turtle does not result in a closed polygon for numbers that are not factors of 360 ( like 7 and 11, because the angle measurment then does not become accurate). To make a gear smaller I could  rduce either the ridge size or the ridge count. However, for 2 gears to work together they must have the same ridge size. After some experimentation The max I could nest was two sets of 5, 15, and 20 ridge-count gears each, with sizes 23 and 13 respectively.

I laser cut the gears both on acrylic and card board. I had a 3" * 3" acrylic board from a previous workshop so I used that and cut the cardboard to the same size. I wanted to see if the gears from one material would fit in the other, and they did.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/M2CutGears.jpeg)
The size-matching gears also fit nicely and do rotate around each other smoothly

Next, I wanted to make nested gears without eliminating the gears centers to allow the insertion of a driving/rotating rod. Spoiler: It did not work, not yet at least but it is almost there. 
The plan was to work with a single set ( 3 gears), and divide the inner gears into quarters and move each quarter further from the gear center, to maintatin the main gear axis. Then have the gear cuts be jigsaw-puzzle-like to assembel them later as you can see below. 
![jigsaw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/JiggsawGears.jpeg)
The had 2 seemingly simple steps: 
1. start the turtle at an ofset from the center, and if the turtle becomes near the gear axis, move it to the next quadrant.
2. write code that makes ajugsaw line from point A to point B.

I struggled with step 1 because in this setup the arc has more cases to consider as the arc's angles depends on whether it is on the axis or not. Ihave not achieved the envisioned design yet, but will update this article once/if I do. 

# Disclaimer/Note : 
the assignment required a 5"*5" fabrication, and I fall a little below this, however: in class it was emphasized that visibility is what matters and my designs are large enough to be visible. Further, and for fun, and hopefully to avoid losing points, here is another extra little thing: an image drawn by hand then etched on both a wooden piece and a piece of fleece fabric, for experimentation:
