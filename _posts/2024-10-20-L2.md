# 1. Task 1: Parametric 3D Designs
For this task I made a cat blob design out of layered lofted ellipses, one for the base, one for the widest tummy area, one for the neck, one for the widest face area, one for the head top, and 2  for the ear bases and 2 for the ear tips.

Although this design was highly parameturized ( use controls each ellipse dimentions, and the distances between ellipses (i.e the cat proportions)) it was so slow to reflect updates on the slicer performance, and the grasshopper flow was too large to fit in a screenshot. Hence I made another simpler design that takes exactly 10 inputs as seen below.

In GH, this looks like this:

This can look difficult to follow, but is is simply a pipeline where the height of each circle of the cat depends on that of the previous one. and the physical location of the GH components matches the cat ( so the first row of operations from the top are for making the ears, and the last row (first from the bottom) is for the cat base. )

This generates shapes that resemble animal heads as seen below.

These are 4 variations, but I decided to fabricate 2 other variation, so along this documant you will see 6 variations of this animal head design. 

# 2. Task 2: Creating a 3D-to-2D Slicer
To slice a given design, the object's length is divided by the material thickness to find the number of layers needed (n). 
Then n equally spaced xy planes are generated such that the object is divided into n layers and each plane cuts through the middle of one layer. In grasshopper, this flow can be done as seen below. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L2GHSlice.png" height="300"> 
This code only slices along the z axis, to support non-standard slicing axes, I sandwiched the slicer with 2 rotators. Say you want to slice an object along an axis a. I first rotate the object to that its axis a aligns with the grid's z axis. then I slice the rotated object along the z axis (thus slicing the initial object along a ). Then I rotate the object, and the resulting countours, back to the original positon. You can see the combined grasshopper flow below. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L2GHSliceAndRotate.png" height="300"> 

The intersection curves of the the planes with the object are moved to the base xy plane, and are spaced out along the x axis with an offset equal to the x-width of the object's bounding box. 
The number sequence used to generate the planes is also used to label them (with engraveable geometry) so the lyers are easily stackable. Intially The number label was placed at the centeroid of each curve, which may not work with shapes of external centroid. To fix this I created a scaled version of each layer, and placed the number lable along the scaled curve, which is always inside the initial curve.  
Also, to support 2 sets of layers ( for slicing across 2 axes), I made the text label also take an id to differenciate the 2 sets ( like horizontal vs vertical slices) as well as made the spacing flow take a y-coordinate so slices along differnt axis do not overlap. I made this y-input a user specified input, but one can automate it with additional logic that computes the minimal distacne between sets based on the sets width. 
The GH projection and labeling flow can be seen below:

Below you can see an example of the old design sliced along 2 axis.

# 3. Task 3: Exporting and Fabricating 2 Design
As said earlier I decided to fabricate 2 additional variations of the second design. Images of the variations I picked to fabricate along with the fabricated result can be seen below.

The full GH flow, to make the cat head, slice it, and project the slices is seen below, where each cluster is a seperate funtionality:

# 4. EXTRA CREDIT 1 - Supporting Slicing in Other Directions 
See task 2 above. 
# 5. EXTRA CREDIT 2 - Multi-directional Slicing with Slot Joints (Advanced):
I attempted this task but faced some problems and eventually stopped to focus on the fabrication and the write up. 
the messy GH file for this attempt can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/code/L2/L2.gh)
