# M1: 'Seeing is believing' - ComFab Examples

## Description

This assignment contains three tasks: Finding a computational design form nature, finding 3 man-made computational designs, and finding 2 researchers/designers of computational fabrication. 


## Task 1: Natural Computational Design
### 1. Botanical Example: 
#### a. Mountain Mahogany

These plants have spiral feather-like seed tails. Unlike feathers, however, the fuzz comming out the tail seems always perpendicular to the tangent to the tail curve. The picture is taken by me at Legion Park. 
#### b. Yucca campestris.

This is the flowering part from the Yucca campestris plant. I Liked the horizontal structure of the woody pod-like petals, which lools like wooden "wires" covered with a thin layer of woody fronds. 

Note: Both pictures are taken by me at Legion Park. I identified the Mountain Mahogany using goole reverse image search, and the Yucca campestris using Plant.id 
### 2. Zoological Example: Dermal ridges and Wrist lines
![dermal ridges](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b66e9859-0909-40d2-9cdf-569469dc8372)
I consider the dermal ridges that form the palm print, and the wrist lines, as computatioal designs because they are patterns that are not entirely random and are interesting to recreate computationally. The study and creation of such patterns would be helpful in robotic "skin" design to better simulate human gripping and wrist movement, as these wrist lines, decpite looking random, occur at the bending spots of the wrist and allow the skin to better fold with the wrist. They are also interesting because they are composed of little crossing diagonal wrinkels. The picture is of my wrist, taken by me. 
### 3. Environment-Built Example: Bowerbird bowers
![Bowerbird Bower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowerbird#/media/File:Bower_of_the_Satin_Bowerbird.jpg)
Bowerbirds make cool standing nests , named bowers. These bowers are interesting due to the skill required to stack sticks to from two curved walls that meet at the top. Computationaly simulating this archetictural pattern would be cool to 3d print.

## Task 2: Man-made Computational Designs
### 1. KAPSARC
![KAPSARC} (https://www.zaha-hadid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/004_zha_kapsarc_musalla_huftoncrow_lowres91.jpg)
King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) is reseach center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, designed by the Archetict Zaha Hadid. As described in her archtict-frim website, from which the photo is obtained, the building design represents cellular honeycomb structures that are not only visually artestic but also serve environmental purposes like "softening the light and heat of the Riyadh Platue" ( Note: Riyadh is a very sunny/hot city , very near the Empty Quarter Desert in Saudi Arabia)

### 3. [Add example 3]

## Task 3: Researchers, Designers, and Artists
### 1. Zaha Hadid
As afformentioned, Zaha hadid is an Iraqi-british award-winning Archetict and designer who's designs represent computational design examples. KAPSARC, mentioned above, is an example of her work, and more can be found in the archive of her erbsite. I find her work interesting because she cleverly makes use of natural light, and her designs stand-alone in a minimalistic yet futuristic way without the need of much extra decoration bo. Her designs do not only look nice fromt the outside but are very interesting and practical to live in - from experience as I lived in KAPSARC for a bit and it is the best appartment I have ever seen/lived in. Her cellular designs remind me of nature - like the cellular patterns on leaves or on human/animal skin, and they are extendable.
