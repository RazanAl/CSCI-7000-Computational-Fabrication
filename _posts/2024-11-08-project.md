# Description

This post is about the final project, for now it only contains the initial description and plan (the proposal), but it will be updated accordingly. 
The post is divided as follows: 
-1. Proposed Project description and goal
-2. Walk-through of Functionality: Has multiple drawings, graphics, and code that demonstrate functionality of the system including outputs and parameters.


A project-related code and files - if any-  will be found [here](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/Project).   

# 1.Project Description
The goal of this project is to creat 3D fabric following the method shown in the paper [DefeXtiles: 3D Printing Quasi-Woven Fabric via Under-Extrusion](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/defextiles-publication/). Specufically, the plan is to recreate the projects and experiment with the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed - This could be through writing my own Gcode or using Prusa slicer settings. For ovious reasons I am resorting to the later. 

The plan is to test with a simple sheet and a skirt, then if that works try to print a more  complex design, like one of the miniature wedding dresses or a sheet of lace, as shown below.
