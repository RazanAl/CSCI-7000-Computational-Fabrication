# Description

This post is about the final project, for now it only contains the initial description and plan, but it will be updated accordingly. 
The post is divided as follows: 
-1. Proposed Project description and goal
-2. Walk-through of Functionality: Has multiple drawings, graphics, and code that demonstrate functionality of the system including outputs and parameters.


A project-related code and files - if any-  will be found [here](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/Project).   

# 1.Project Description
The goal of this project is to creat 3D fabric following the method shown in the paper [DefeXtiles: 3D Printing Quasi-Woven Fabric via Under-Extrusion](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/defextiles-publication/).

Specufically, the plan is to recreate some of the projects and experiment with the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed - This could be through writing my own Gcode or using Prusa slicer settings. For ovious reasons I am resorting to the later. The below image show sample projects from the paper - not all done with PLA so I will only consider PLA-based designs. 
The figure below, from the paper, can be used to select the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed. These 2 are the main parameters of the project, as design parameters are to be chosen later depending on the chosen design.

The plan is to test with a simple sheet and a skirt, then if that works try to print a more  complex design, like a sheet of lace or one of the miniature wedding dresses from the paper (or similar), as shown below.

# 2.Functionality - A plan 
To generate the lace pattern, I tried following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGbYo4FTkOQ) to convert a lace image into a grasshopper gepmetry instead of creating the design from scratch. This is still under construction. 

The plan is to start experimenting with printing settings on Monday Dec 2nd, and to start with 2 basic shapes: a square that is a single layer high, and a cylinder that is a single layer thick. All attempted designs will be in a single grasshopper file [here]()
