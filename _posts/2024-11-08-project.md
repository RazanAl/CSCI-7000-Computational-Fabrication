A project-related code files -if any-  will be found [here](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/Project).   

# 1.Introduction and inspiration
The goal of this project is to creat 3D fabric following the method shown in the paper [DefeXtiles: 3D Printing Quasi-Woven Fabric via Under-Extrusion](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/defextiles-publication/).  
Specefically, the plan was initially to recreate some of the projects and experiment with the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed to see their impact on the resulting fabric. The paper experiments with multiple printing material, but we will stick to PLA on the Prusa MK3 printer.   

The figure below, from the paper, can be used to select the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed. These 2 are the main parameters of the project, as design parameters are to be chosen later depending on the chosen design.

The plan is to test with a simple sheet, then if that works try to print a more complex design, like a sheet of lace or one of the miniature wedding dresses from the paper (or similar), as shown below.

I ended up doing the first half of the plan: experimenting printing sheets with different settings, but extending experiments to the prusa MKS4+ printer too.   

# 2. Computational approach details (parameters, algorithms, and fails)
## 1. Test Cylinder:   
I first printed a Cylinder that is 0.3 mm thick, with 30mm radius and 70mm height with the Prusa MK3 printer. 
That took a long time so for later prints I tested on the same cylinder with the height (z-axis) scaled 50% via the prusa slicer.   
## 2. Lace Design:   
Initially Ambitiuos, I attempted to generate the lace pattern. I tried following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGbYo4FTkOQ) to convert a lace image (found online) into a grasshopper gepmetry instead of creating the design from scratch.   
The desing I picked is highly detailed as seen below:      
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/proj_laceDesign.jpg" height="300">   
So from the way it looks in Rhino as seen below, I doubt it will look good once done.   
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/proj_GH_lace.jpeg" height="300">   
So I found a Simpler design that I could also print on a smaller scale as below (forgot to save the source, googles "lace patterns"): 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/proj_laceDesign4.jpeg" height="300">   
and I could model it to print it flat:   
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/proj_lace_flat.jpeg" height="300">  
However, the lines connecting the lace pattern were too small so they were removed by the slicer. Morphing the lace design on the cylinder was not successful*, but I had to start printing so I did not bother fix it.   
instead, I exprted the flat design, and made it 3 layers thicke in the slicer, then printed it horizontally like a wall or a paravan, and printed it with supports to fill the gaps between layers.

 *It became just a smooth cylender.  I tried making it an ellips so the lace is less curved, but that also came out as a simple elipse - except, the elipse stl is way too large, larger than I can push to or drop in github. Since it is not an essential part ( it is just a plain ellipse stl), I chose to omit it instead of using github lfs.   

# 3. Fabrication Process and outputs
Below is a picture of all attempted prints. The attached labeles have the format  MKX Yn Zs Wm which means it is printed with printer MKX, nozzle diameter Y, Z speed (in mm/s), and W extrusion multiplier.   
Labels missing the printer type and nozzle diameter use the MK4S with 0.6 nozzle. The MK3S printer used uses a 0.4 nozzle diameter.

In addition to the ones shown, there were a few attempts that were blown off or were a total failure. For example, printing the lace wall with a higher speed and using a double layer instead of triple, started deforming mid print, then eventually was blown out (lost it aborted the print before I could take a photo of it).   
And printing on the MK4S with a 0.6 nozzle diameter, using 0.4 extrusion multiplier and 25mm/s speed was printing in air (simply resulted in a wavy thread of filamnet instead of a cylinder).  
Among All printed outputs, the pictures below show the -almost- successful ones, besides the lace wall which turned out rigid and not as felxible as a single layer print.

This is the first print I attempted. I printed it as a cylender then cut it through the seam. The look of it sort of resembles fabric.

This is not fabric-like, but it is a cool error. This was supposed to print the same original cylender, just with 50% height to reduce print time (35mm high instead of 70).  
The theory is that the print speed is faster than the PLA cooling speed so it is dragged in areas where the printer reached the target speed, and only the parts where the printer is accelerating (still not so fast) are printed correctly.

This cylender is the original cylender scaled to 50% in all dimensions. It was printed upside down. You can see that the first printed layers (top) do somewhat look like fabric weaves. 
The center layers are solid for some reason,   

# 4. Discussion and Reflection
Discuss whether your project turned out as you had hoped. Were things more difficult or easy than you had thought? 
What aspects would improve if you had more time? 
What would you do differently next time? 
There were parts that turned somewhat as expected, like woven-like patterns. However, for the most part, the project turned out harder than I thought. I am certain I could generate the cylendrical lace design if I put more time and effort into it, but it is not as simple as I thought it would be, and it takes a very long computational time!
Regarding the fabrication process, my plan was to experiment with printing settings and learn more about their impacts on printing outcomes, rather than strictly replicate the paper. Still, I did not expect my results to vary that much from the paper. The paper uses the Prusa MK3S printer, and almost all my prints on MK4, even with a 0.4 nozzle diameter, turned out as single layer plastic, or did not print at all. 
If I had the time, and a better access to a 3D printer, I would approach the project in a more systemic way instead of my somewhat random approach. I selected a few settings combinations from the paper and used them, but I also varied the printer and the design dimentions.I am glad I did that becasue changing the printer helped better understand how the design should depend on the tool, but I also think it would be interesting to see the results of an experiment with more controlled parameters.
