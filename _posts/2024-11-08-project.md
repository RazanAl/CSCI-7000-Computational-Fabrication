# Description

This post is about the final project, for now it only contains the initial description and plan, but it will be updated accordingly. 
The post is divided as follows: 
-1. Proposed Project description and goal
-2. Walk-through of Functionality: Has multiple drawings, graphics, and code that demonstrate functionality of the system including outputs and parameters.


A project-related code files -if any-  will be found [here](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/Project).   

# 1.Project Description
The goal of this project is to creat 3D fabric following the method shown in the paper [DefeXtiles: 3D Printing Quasi-Woven Fabric via Under-Extrusion](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/defextiles-publication/).

Specufically, the plan is to recreate some of the projects and experiment with the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed - This could be through writing my own Gcode or using Prusa slicer settings. For ovious reasons I am resorting to the later. The below image show sample projects from the paper - not all done with PLA so I will only consider PLA-based designs. 
The figure below, from the paper, can be used to select the extrusion multiplier and the printing speed. These 2 are the main parameters of the project, as design parameters are to be chosen later depending on the chosen design.

The plan is to test with a simple sheet and a skirt, then if that works try to print a more  complex design, like a sheet of lace or one of the miniature wedding dresses from the paper (or similar), as shown below.

# 2.Functionality - A plan 
To generate the lace pattern, I tried following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGbYo4FTkOQ) to convert a lace image (found online) into a grasshopper gepmetry instead of creating the design from scratch. 
The desing I picked is highly detailed as seen below:

So from the way it looks in Rhino as seen below, I doubt it will look good once done.

Hence I am looking for a simpler lace pattern that is still nicelooking. 


The plan is to start experimenting with printing settings on Monday Dec 2nd, and to start with 2 basic shapes: a square that is a single layer high, and a cylinder that is a single layer thick.
