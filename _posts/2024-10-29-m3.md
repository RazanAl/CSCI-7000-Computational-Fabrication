# Description

This mini assignment has 2 tasks 
-Task 1: Create Parametric Table or Chair Designs
-Task 2: Fabricate Your Designs With 3D Printing

A single grasshopper file with all parts can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/code/M3/M3_furniture.gh) . 
All files, including code and exprted STLs can be found here  [here](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/M3) 

# 1.Task 1: Create Parametric Table or Chair Designs 
For this task I made a Locket-inspired table that opens up to some storage. I initially follwoed [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3G8ZxsRElI)  to create the table body, which I refer to as "the locket". I followed the tutorial with the following differences: 
## 1. Paramatrize the design by using grasshopper - this took way more time than the video. 
The tutorial does not use grasshopper or allow paramaturization. Below you can see the GH diagrams for crating the locket frame and the hinge ( sperately). The locket dimentions and thickness, and the hinge diamater and placement relative to the locket ellipsoid are adjustable.

## 2. Adjust the hinge to allow full 180 opening. 
Before the locket parts are unioned with the corresponding locket parts, the locket top is rotated 180 degrees to note and eliminate the locket side's overlap that would prevent the lockt from fully opening. Below is the GH flow that increases the locket rotation span then connects it to the hing parts:

## 3.Add legs to make it a table ( thogh one can ommit the legs for a little ottoman)
The GH flow below shows how the legs are created. It starts with parameturized rectangle below the locket and parallel to the xy plane, this represents where the table legs will touch the ground. 4 circles with a changable radius r are created at the vertices of the rectangle. This shape is duplicated inside the locket frame, below the storage cavity, with an optional scale-down to create tapering legs, and a scale-independent circle radius control. Each circle from the top is lofted with the corrospoding circle at the base to generate the legs.

Note that not all paramater combinations are useful, some combinations, for example, may place the legs top beyond the locket cavity,thus creating a table with protruding legs! 
## 4. Flatten the "locket top" to make a functional resting surface.
The simplisity of this task is reflected on the size of its GH flow below. This is as simple as splitting the top with a parallal plane. The z position of the plane is controlable, which changes the table height slightly as well as the usable flat table surface. However, the z axis can also be wrongly chosen to intersect the locket cavity, thus creating a hole in the tabletop. Unless that is what you're aiming for, then it is not wrong.

I initially planned to use wire for pinning the hinge, but then decided to make a custom pin as seen below, where the size of hinge hole is paramaturized relative to the hinge size, and the size of the pin is paramaturized raltive to the hole size. Pin = the thinge that is inserted in the hinge to keep the 2 pieces together. 
This is the simplist pin, so it is not secure, a better version could have some form of stoppers at the end, but this somple pin should do the job for now. 

Here are some sample results for this table design:

Note: The fabricated variations are not neccarily from the ones shown above. 

# 2. Task 2: Fabricate Your Designs With 3D Printing
The design looked nice on screen, but the first round of printing turned out catastrophic for the following reasons: 

##1. I minimized the tables as best as I could to reduce the printing time, which made the hinge too small, almost smaller than the printing nozzle. 
##2. I was afraid I would break the legs when trying to remove supports, so I printed the base upside down. This resulted in filling the storage cavity with supports that I could not remove. 
##3. One table design had thin legs that minimally intersect the base. This meant that there was not enough printed material to keep the legs attached to the table body, so they broke off quickly. 

In the second round of printing, I used 2 printers, where in the first I printed table parts with a larger hinge and thicker legs. This was estimated to take 6 hours. On the second printer, I printed 2 variants of a stacked table. These were supposed to print as a single object with no moving parts as backup. I made the legs short but thick  to reduce time but also ensure the stability of the leggs. You can see the faild prints below.

I assume the print on the  first printer failed because I found the printer used by someone else near the end of the estimated print time, but could not find any part on top of the printers, where finished prints are usually found. 
The full tables from the second printer were as expectd, except that much of the design value was lost. In the Picture, it looks like 2 black bolbs, but with little attention you can se the tables have little blob legs and 2 different thicknesses. The base kept the crveture well, but the top sunk in a little, with a curveture slightly opposie to the design.

with the successfully printed ones being the last : table5 & table6
