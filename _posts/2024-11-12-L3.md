# 1. Task 1: Grasshopper slicer
The stages are prelabled making the grasshopper flow below self explanatory.

This results in the following slicing of the 1 and 5 layer cylinders respectively:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_5LSliced.png" height="300">   
The slicing lines have a 0.3 mm spacing so the extruded lines, which are 0.3mm thick, touch but not overlap ( 100% fill ).
In the infill creation section, you can see that the spacing input depends on a division of 1/1 ( A/B), here B represnets the infill density, so B=1, shown above, represents 100% density.
So setting B to 0.25 for example yields a spacing of 4*layer_height which corresponds to 25% infill density. Images below show 10%, 20%, and 50% infill respectively.

# 2. Task 2:G-code generation with Python
The following 2 screenshorts show the completion of the gcode generation code, full code can be found in the python code element of the grasshopper file in the [L3 code files folder](https://github.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/tree/main/code/L3).

# 3. Task 3: G-code testing

The resulting gcode is exported using the pancake plugin, and saved as output-NumLayersl_DensityP_InfillTypeI.gcode. So output-1l_0.5P_rectI.gcode is the gcode for a single layer cylinder with 0.5% rectangular infill.
below are snippets from the beginning and end of the resulting gcode, respectfuly. The blue lines represent extruding movements, while the purple lines show non-extruding transitions.

figures below show that the code can be successfuly simulated with [ZupFe simulator](https://zupfe.velor.ca), and passes all 25 course tests.

# 4. Task 4: Comparing slicers
The lower 2 cylinders used the prusa slicer, the top one uses my slicer. You can see that mine has a build up of unwanted filamnet, I assume near where the extruder moves up a layer in each round.   
This could be due to never pulling back the filamnet after extruding for each line. This could also explain why my cylinder has bumpy top (which is not so clear in the image) unlike the smooth prusa's top.

# 5. EXTRA CREDIT 1: Control infill density 
See part 1 for details. Below are the results of the Gcode simulaion for 10%,20%, 50%, and 100% infill densities, respectively.

# 6. EXTRA CREDIT 2: Optimize toolpath
To attempt this first, I made the GH sequence below to flip the orientation/direction of every other infill line, so they allign better.       
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_GH_optmize.png" height="250">   
which resulted the following simulation and simulation path:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_sim_opt1_path.png" height="250">   
While this is still much better the original shown below:

The rubric reguires the path to be continues without stopping an extrusion which only required adding a "connect curves" component to connect the infil lines before merging them with the boundry lines.   
The full GH script in code folder is an updated one that reflects this change. This also improved transitions without extrusions as seen below:

# 7. EXTRA CREDIT 3: Create infill paterns
For each of the 3 infill paterns, I only changed the infil generation section before merging the infill and boundry contours.   
I based all 3 patterns on the infill-spacing paramater used to control density.   
For each pattern, 100% density was computed such that infill lines touch each other.     
for concentric curves this is straight forward as I mapped the infill lines spacing to the concentric shapes spacing as seen below:  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_GH_concentric.png" height="250"> 
The GH code shows an error with the offset component, but as you will see in the simulations below, this did not impactd, 
For the honeycomb, I mapped the spacing to the distance between 2 parallel sides of the hexagons. I also computed the needed dimensions to cover the contour ( in terms of number of hexagons)
by simple trignometry: it is clear that in one direction hexagons are side to side, with the paralled side of the hexagon have a distance of 2*s/sqrt(3) (from phythagorian theorem on a 30-60 right triangle) where s is the length of the side of the hexagon.   
on the other dimension, hexagons are aligned vertix to vertix, with the distance between vertices equal to 2*s (seen by connecting vertices to the polygon center and forming equalatiral triangles).  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_GH_honeycomb.png" height="250"> 

For the hilbert curve, I used the L-system defined in wikipidea. I also used the formula: stepSize = WindowSize/(2^order)-1 ( which I saw somewhere while looking as (2^order)+1 but "-" seemed more accutate.)
I rounded the order up because it needs to be an integer, but changed the window size accordingly to fully cover the boundry contour. Here windoSize refers to the length of one dimention of the completed hilbert curve diagram, before intersecting it with the boundry contour.   
To generate the curve I implemented the Lsystem in python to generate the points and lines. the python code can be found in the GH sketch, on the "Hilbert curve" group ( the GH file includes all tasks with 1 group per task/sub-task).  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazanAl/CSCI-7000-Computational-Fabrication/refs/heads/main/imgs/L3_GH_hilbertCurve.png" height="250"> 

because they are highly detailed patterns, the full-density honeycomb and the hilbert curve worked better after lowering the cuve divition distance. So, and to avoid risk, I desided to print those with a lower density.   
The simulations looked promising though as you can see here:

# 8. EXTRA CREDIT 4: 
For a seamless vase-mode print, I discritirized the curves, then moved each point up a little such that the last point of each layer is shifted by layer height. 
I then connected all the points, thus making a single smooth heilix from the boundry contours. The process is shown in the GH screenshot below.

This creates the following seamless simulation:
